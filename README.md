  ## Usage:
    This App was designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js and Express.js. I deployed this application on GitHub and Heroku.

    As a user, this application will allow the user to write notes and save the notes. The user can add however many notes he/she wants. The user can also delete any notes the user has added. When the user saves his/her notes and refreshes the page or leaves the browswer, then returns to the note-taker app, the user's saved notes will still be visible/available. This app can also be used as a way for the user to keep track of his/her daily activities, if they choose to.
